The increasing proliferation of wireless devices has led to significant challenges in managing
electromagnetic interference (EMI) within residential environments. This paper proposes an
innovative, cost-effective solution using adaptive metamaterial shielding combined with
intelligent EMI detection algorithms. We present the problem, analyze existing limitations,
and suggest a novel approach using tunable frequency-selective surfaces (FSS) and AI-based
detection mechanisms.
